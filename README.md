## Overview

SmilePro Dental is a production-ready dental clinic web application that connects patients to your practice through a sleek, responsive website. Patients can browse services, meet the doctors, read verified reviews, and book appointments online. Clinic staff manage everything through a secure admin dashboard with role-based access control.

The app uses **Lovable Cloud** (powered by Supabase) for its backend — providing authentication, PostgreSQL database, real-time subscriptions, and Row-Level Security out of the box.

## Database Schema

### Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `appointments` | Patient bookings: name, phone, email, service, doctor, date, time_slot, status (pending/confirmed/completed/cancelled) |
| `clinic_settings` | Single-row config: clinic name, address, phone, email, opening/closing times, slot duration, logo URL |
| `doctors` | Doctor profiles: name, specialization, qualifications, experience, bio, image_url |
| `holidays` | Blocked dates with reason; prevents booking on these days |
| `reviews` | Patient reviews: name, rating (1-5), comment, approved (boolean) |
| `services` | Dental services: name, description, price, duration_minutes, active, sort_order |
| `user_roles` | Role-based access: links auth.users to roles (`admin`, `user`) |

### Enums

- `app_role`: `admin`, `user`

### Functions

- `has_role(user_id, role)` — Security definer function for RLS policies to check user roles without recursion.

### Row-Level Security (RLS)

All tables have RLS enabled:
- `appointments` — Authenticated users can manage; admins have full access
- `services`, `doctors`, `holidays`, `reviews` — Public read for active items; admin CRUD
- `clinic_settings` — Public read; admin update
- `user_roles` — Read for authenticated users; full access for service role

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Bun (recommended) or npm

### Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### Run Development Server

```bash
bun run dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:8080` by default.

### Build for Production

```bash
bun run build
```

### Run Tests

```bash
bun run test        # Unit tests (Vitest)
bun run test:watch  # Watch mode
```

---

## Environment Variables

The project uses Vite environment variables. These are automatically injected by Lovable Cloud:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Your Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Public anon key for Supabase client |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` | Supabase project ID |

> **Note:** The `.env` file is auto-managed by Lovable Cloud. Do not edit it manually.

---

## Admin Authentication

1. Navigate to `/admin/login`
2. Sign in with admin credentials
3. The system checks the `user_roles` table for `role = 'admin'`
4. Non-admin users are signed out and redirected back to login

### Setting Up the First Admin

Run this SQL in your Lovable Cloud database (or via migration):

```sql
-- After creating the user through Supabase Auth
INSERT INTO public.user_roles (user_id, role)
VALUES ('<ADMIN_USER_UUID>', 'admin');
```

---

## Deployment

This project is built with Vite and deploys seamlessly on **Lovable**.

1. Push your changes
2. Lovable automatically builds and deploys
3. Visit your published URL

The project is also compatible with Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting that supports SPA routing (ensure fallback to `index.html`).

---

## Key Design Decisions

- **No prices on the public site** — The booking flow is designed to drive action first; prices are managed internally in the admin panel and shown on PDF invoices.
- **Auto-generated time slots** — Slot times are calculated dynamically from `clinic_settings.opening_time`, `closing_time`, and `slot_duration_minutes`. Changing clinic hours instantly updates the booking calendar.
- **Real-time slot protection** — When a patient picks a date, the app subscribes to Supabase Realtime to instantly hide slots that just got booked by another patient (race-condition guard on submit too).
- **Holiday tooltip system** — Blocked dates show the reason on hover in both the admin calendar and the patient booking calendar.
- **Closed Today banner** — Automatically appears on the homepage if today's date exists in the `holidays` table.
